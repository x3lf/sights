There are a lot of traditional Russian temples, theaters, former merchant mansions in Voronezh, which captivate the eye with their noble and elegant appearance. Tourists should also pay attention to the monuments that perpetuate the image of the heroes of the Great Patriotic War. Equally interesting is the "Voronezh Sea" - a huge city reservoir, stretching for tens of kilometers.
