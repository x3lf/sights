Voronezh is worth visiting not only for its interesting museums, numerous parks and picturesque squares. There are also funny monuments to animals - heroes of famous literary works, and monument copies of the first Petrovsky ships. As well as unusual buildings in the Art Nouveau and Gothic style of the late XIX-XX centuries, which is quite surprising for the city, located in the south of Central Russia.
